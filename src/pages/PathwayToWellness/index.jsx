        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Years of weight loss trials have taught me a lot, and now as I&apos;m
          navigating my 40s, it&apos;s time for a practical and sustainable
          approach. I&apos;m pairing the 16/8 intermittent fasting method with
          mindful eating and a dedicated exercise regimen to improve my fitness
          and mental clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m committed to this path and to sharing the highs and lows
          transparently. If you&apos;re on a similar quest, let&apos;s connect
          and support each other.
        </p>
        <h1>Fitness Goals:</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m on a mission to reclaim my healthâ€”to not just feel better,
          but to reengage actively with the sports I love. My goal is to manage
          my weight effectively as I move through this decade of life.
        </p>
