      <p>We are Eleanor and Alana</p>

      <p>Together we have chased our dream of moving to Cornwall and buying the most amazing little farmhouse in the middle of nowhere but central to everywhere... in Cornwall that is ðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>We love trips to the beach and making improvements to our miniature smallholding</p>
      <p>We love entertaining and sharing with our friends and loved ones</p>
      <p>Join us as we share our journey, everything from growing our own, to boating, to career changes, to wellness and beyond</p>
